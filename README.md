# <City-Weather-Checker>

## Description

My motivation for this application was to be able to search for a specific city's weather for the day and the following 5 days so the user can plan a trip accordingly.
I built this project to be able to plan trips easier. The problem it solved is that now you won't be rained in on a trip. I learned alot about using the bulma css and
ajax for fetching the api


## Usage

Type a city name in the search bar and hit submit and it will bring up todays weather for that city and the next 5 days aswell in smaller boxes.
